 Instant Watermark Maker
A lightweight, single-file HTML tool that allows you to add text watermarks to images directly in your browser. It is privacy-focused, meaning your photos are processed locally on your device and are never uploaded to a server.
 Features
• 100% Client-Side: No server required. Your images never leave your computer.
• Real-Time Preview: See changes instantly as you type or adjust settings.
• 3 Watermark Styles:
• Center: Large, bold text in the middle.
• Bottom-Right: Subtle, professional signature style.
• Tiled: Repeats the text diagonally across the entire image (great for stock photos).
• Customization: Adjust opacity (transparency), text color, and text content.
• High-Res Export: Downloads the image at its original resolution, not a compressed screenshot.
